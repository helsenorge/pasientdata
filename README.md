# PasientData

### About the project

This is a project done by 5 summer interns, who will find and create a solution for finding and collecting data from devices that patients use. They will do user tests as well as develop a webapp for visualising and storing data with the FHIR standard.

#### How to run

Before running the program, take a look at [setup](https://github.com/helsenorgelab/pasientdata#setup)

Start by installing packages:

```
npm install
```

(if missing packages, install from error messages)

Run using npm:

```
npm start
```

## Setup

Start by setting up your editors for the [source/backend](https://github.com/helsenorgelab/pasientdata/tree/master/src/Spark) and the [web/frontend](https://github.com/helsenorgelab/pasientdata/tree/master/WEB/src), we recommend using [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) for the backend and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for the frontend.
Both programs can be downloaded here:

- Visual Studio: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/
- Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/

When you have completed you can clone this repo:

  - Click on "Credentials" on the left
    - Click on "OAuth consent screen" from the tabs
      - Fill in application name
      - Click "add scope" and add the APIs needed (our case: activity.read, body.read and nutrition.read. You will need to add one at the time.)
      - Click save
    - Click the "Credentials" from the tabs
      - Click "Create credentials", then "Oauth client ID"
      - Choose "Web application"
      - Give it a name
      - Add "Authorized JavaScript origins" (http://localhost:3000, if you are still in development environment)
      - Add "Authorized redirect URIs" (also http://localhost:3000 if you have a single page app)
- Copy your clientID and paste it over the clientID in the "[googleFit.js](https://github.com/helsenorgelab/pasientdata/blob/master/WEB/src/api/googleFit.js)" file under the [api folder](https://github.com/helsenorgelab/pasientdata/tree/master/WEB/src/api).

## Additional information

### Google Fit Endpoints:

To retrieve information from Google, you can use a get request with the API call: "https://www.googleapis.com/fitness/v1/users/me/dataSources/". This will output all the datasources you have available, you will need to define the scope to the type of dataSources you want. After you have specified the dataSource, you can ask for a specific dataSet which will be a set between a specific timeintervall in nanoseconds (e.g. from: 631148400000000000 = 01/01/1990 00:00 GMT+1, to 1735686000000000000 = 01/01/2025 00:00 GMT+1).
